You must make prototypes of your service to explore, share and test different designs before you commit to building anything.

You can quickly make and test multiple prototypes and discard the ones that donâ€™t test well.

Making prototypes is important because it:

- improves the usability of your service
- helps you to make sure youâ€™re building the right service for your users
- helps your whole team to get a shared understanding about the future of your service
- allows your team to explore design ideas much faster and at lower risk than using your production code

## Topics, I talk about

- Blinds are not our target group (Accessibility 101)
